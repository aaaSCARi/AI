  The packaging was really good even for a memory card which one can easily misunderstand for a mobile or similar stuff visuall.However there are a lot of fake ones available so in order to find out which one is real and which is fake check the sides of the memory card.The real ones edges will be white in colour while the fake ones have black coloured edges.Fast data transferring Adapter is include with this card.Pros:-1- The read/write speed of the card through the adapter is around 50/25 mbps.2- The read/write speed of the card through my mobile ZenFone 2 ZE550ML variant with the original cable is around 40/28 mbps well technically it is more than what we get through the original adapter.3- The card really is water proof since I accidentally dropped a glass of water on it and it was still working fine without any problems.4-This card is really fast so fast that I have like 40 movies on my mobile(literally and I am not joking) 10 GB of video songs and a few pictures and stuff and even with only 300 MB of free space the memory card never hangs.5- I usually carry a lot of movies and compressed RAR files I have like roughly 900 files on my memory card right now and I was able to copy around 40 GB of this data using my mobile cable not THROUGH a adapter in 30 minutes give or take 3 minutes from my pc to the card.6- I copied the same data back to my pc using the same setup and was able to copy them all in comically the same amount of time.

  The problem with this memory card is highspeed recording. I am using it in my note 8 and when I try to record slowmotion videos, the recording gets stuck instead of being a smooth one. I have used sandisk and transcend memory cards instead of this for the same purpose without any problems. Ofcourse the work around is to record it directly to your phone storage instead of the external card. So it's ok. But do consider the above mentioned point before purchase. For any other work this card is quite good.

  Good read and write speed.Connected the 128 GB sd card to the USB 3 port using a USB 3 card reader and copied mp4 and mkv video files to it and the card showed a write speed in between 60 and 66 MB/s.While copying from the SD card to HDD(7200 RPM HDD), the write speed is in between 65 and 75 MB/s. I also tested the 64 GB U3 variant and it showed a write speed in between 55 and 65 MB/s while copying to the card. So in my case, the 128 GB card showed good results. Both the cards seem to be original and I am satisfied with the quality of the products. I had a Samsung 128 GB U1 class Micro Sd card which got corrupted and and did not even last one year. Hope this will  last long.

  Simply mind blowing product .. flawlessly recording of 4k recording.The write speed of the card is good. If u want to check ur card speed simply buy USB 3 card reader and put ur memory card in it then plug it to usb 3 port of ur laptop or computer what u have. I got write speed of 75 mb/sec and read speed to 90 mb/sec.There is lots of fake card available in online..if u want to purchase card simply ask the seller about it from where is it made from like made in China,Japan, Europe,korea, Philippines or Vietnam.Don't buy made in china very poor quality .Made in Vietnam is super quality but not available in India.Made in Philippines , Japan or Korea is best I have tested and I got good respond on it.

  First of all thank Amazon for wonderful fast delivery before time.  The product is good  I am already using samsung 4 memory cards of 16GB, 32GB,  64 GB and this new one 64GB .  Samsung is a good brand like sandisk is also a good one but it charge prices more than other brands that is too bad,  not fair enough.  Coming to durability I'm using others from past 5 yrs no issues till now,  next one about its quality very good,  now. If I talk about  about  it's storage capacity it disappoints me little bit as it actually offers 59GB(approx)  out 64GB ,I don't know what the hell is remaining 5Gb,  they are doing means it contains application or system apps.  But still 5GB is a very big storage which is proving to be unuseful.  Otherwise overall good.

  Product shipment fast. Most Samsung card in local store are duplicates. This one from Appario found original. Made in Philippines. Card i got from Malaysia last year made in Malaysia from Samsung had 95 and 83mbps. Indian version seem little slow . I found read speed surprisingly low than san disk. But SanDisk write speed is 35mbps in india for same price. Sandisk A1 card. So I'm okey with overall. SanDisk read is always above 70mbps in A1 card above 64gb. 32 gb cards of both brands have less speed. I don't know y. Speed is depend on size of card

  Samsung Evo Plus Class 10 is the best and top-of-the-line micro SD card you can buy. Better performance (read/write speeds) than SanDisk class 10. I purchased it at Rs. 614/- Look out for offers during festivals and season sales, the price fluctuates between Rs. 600-1000.

  i have purchased it , and after 2 years of use it stop working then i contacted samsung service center,but they just checked and said their is scratch on memory card so I can not claim warranty, they will check the scratches under the microscope so if once you purchased it then forgot about the warranty. very bad experience, even sandisk memory card is way more better and cheaper using since more then 6 years.

  Nice and fast memory card. i have had issues with other memory cards which auto unmount and mount due to data read failures. there is no such error with this one. It has been quite stable and lets me store lots of data and the read speeds are almost as if i am moving data in the internal memory.no dislikes as of now.

  I got the 64 gigs version of this microSD card for my Poco F1 at 1000 bucks. Had an old 32 gigs card before, where I had all my media library. I backed it up to my laptop, then transferred it to this new card. Got a steady 20 MB/s speed for moving around 20 gigs of data. But when transferring media from my phone to this card, it maintained a speed of around 80 MB/s. Overall, I'm happy with this purchase.

  Go through my review once before buying this memory card.Using this memory card since a month now. Packaging has hologram so I'm relieved about genuineness. This card was my first choice as it supports 4K recording so I'm using it in both action camera and mobile.Performance : 95%Quality : 95%Features : 90%Value for money : 95%Overall Rating: 94%PERFORMANCE :I did benchmark tests & performance was considerable. Read & write speeds are not what Samsung advertised but it's acceptable as performance varies with many factors.BENCHMARK RESULT :Read : 84 MB/sWrite : 42 MB/s[ Check screenshots added with review ]HARDWARE :This memory card is Class 10 UHS - I U3 certified. It's water-proof, temperature proof, magnet proof and X-Ray proof as well so I'm not worried about any loss of data under such conditions.FINAL VERDICT :Samsung Evo Plus is an easy buy because it's fast enough for a smartphone or tablet and action camera as well. It comes with a full-size SD adapter, so don't worry about buying one separately and also it comes with 10 year warranty for peace of mind.I hope this helped you.

  Beast of a deal! Functionally no issues. Works like a charm. Gives very good read/write speeds in my Redmi Note 4.Though it appears to be of the standard microSD card dimensions, it was not a perfect fit in the Redmi Note 4 tray. I was not able to slot it perfectly onto the tray. However, the tray can be closed despite the ill-fitting card, so am able to use it.Would have given full 5 stars if not for the tolerance issue with slotting-in onto the card tray.

  The product from samsung is very good .It gives you good read and write speed . In my test it gave me around 30mb write speed. I have booked this product one from amazon and one from flipkart at the rate of Rs. 500/= on offer period.Both the product are original and good read and write speed.I am happy with my purchase and ordered one more from flipkart because the courier service of flipkart is better than amazon. They always deliver the product at home . But amazon courier boy always left the product here and there and they dont mind to inform us where they left our product and later  We have to search for it asking everyone. Especially this things happen when we order on prepaid. So, I prefer cash on delivery than prepaid. That is the only minus point, otherwise every thing is fine.

  I was earlier sent a fake card which I identified in 1 second.Then I ordered a replacement online through Amazon and now I finally got an ORIGINAL Samsung card.I've attached photos the real card's packaging, so you may decide wisely what card you're getting... If you feel something is wrong (detail not matching order, wrong fonts, bad quality print, etc.) return it by going to \"My order\" on Amazon and ask for original one immediately....The write speed, as guaranteed by U3 marking should be above 30MB/ second as per Memory card association.In my card it was claimed to be 90MB/ second on package, and 100MB/ second read speed.Of course, on an older system with no so accurate readers, you get around 20 MB/ second maximum. But on newer mobiles phones, you do get upto 60-90 MB/second or so.This card is good for phones supporting SDXC, and remember, it may also be supported on phones which claim to support much less.Example, My Redmi 2 Prime claimed to support only 32GB, and guess what, 64 and even 128 GB cards from both Samsung and Sandisk were supported and ran awesome!! Please remember SDXC standard supports very high capacities, maybe upto 512 GB. SDHC, an older standard supports only upto 32GB.Card was made in Phillipines. A useful SD adaptor (with a writing-lock switch) was supplied which was made in China.Capacity that came was 119GB, which is slightly more than 128,000,000,000 bytes.(The difference in capacity is due to 1024 bytes=1KB and 1024KB= 1MB and 1024 MB = 1GB).

  The memory card worked fine for 8 months (October 2018- June 2019 ), after which I lost 28 gb data overnight, followed by the remaining 29 gb in the following 2 days (for which I had the foresight to take backup, thank God), and then the card got corrupted. I formatted it on my phone and started using it again, thinking all was well now. Well guess what, I lost all data AGAIN AFTER FORMATTING and the card again being shown \"corrupted\" on my phone. What use is a memory card if I have to take backup of everything I store on it ? If I had to take backup of my storage source (card) everytime I used it, wouldn't i just use the backup source as my primary storage instead ? Horrible product from Samsung that has managed to give me a new level of trust issues. I don't have the time nor energy to pursue the warranty which I'm expecting will turn out to be another scam on Samsung's part. Waste of time, waste of money and a new lesson in life: always take backup, especially while using sh*t products from Samsung.

  Don't buy this product. If you store an mobile app data on sd card then it allows to access mobile, it frequently restart while using app stored on sd card. The SD card I received may be duplicate the reasons is On cover wrote made in Korea but when look to sd card its wrote made in Philippines and SD card adapter its written made in China. I test it 3 devices it shows same behavior, its frequently switching off mobile. Its not good for mobile. Also it increases the time of charging of mobile. From these things I reach to the conclusion its not original Samsung card. If you love your mobile and devices then don't use this card. I recommend Strontium card that best in use.

  This is a proper storage card, with no issues in data transfer and storage. Rate of data transmission is good, can be used as phones default storage with no loss in speed/efficiency.Durability is great, won't break on falling or under a bit pressure, water proof - just dry it out first before using. I bought the 64 gb variant at offer price, one gets about 61gb depending on the phone with which you are using. On offer price of Rs 949 should buy it.

  First off the average user or photographer will have no trouble with this card, as it has great storage capacity. I've been using one for about a year now and it still performs well, although with a few hiccups here and there. However, this is not a fast card, and I cannot recommend it for any professional use. Using burst mode on my Nikon (shooting RAW) shows a considerable lag between the shots being taken and written to the card - so you'll be severely limited in your shooting capacity. It also takes a considerable amount of time to copy data on/off so the \"100MB/s\" sales pitch is just a gimmick.Occasionally, the card refuses to read on my camera, for no apparent reason.That being said this is a very affordable option for a bit of hobby photography or for storing your files, but I wouldn't trust its reliability and I certainly don't recommend it for professional work. Buy something like a Samsung Pro SDXC or PNY card for that instead.

  It's the second time i got bluffed.Now it got \" Write protected\" itself.Only readable on PC even then can't format or delete anything from it.As stored data is confidential even can't take it to samsung service center.In nutshell,its just samsung's unfair practise to make such product in a way, so innocent customer buy it again & again.Very disappointed !!!!!

  This is my fourth Samsung evo microsd and am buying repeatedly since I am confident about quality and performance. I use it for my car dash cam which means it is put to test in the harshest environment continuously and has come out with flying colours so far.

  It has only been a couple of months when I bought this card so can’t comment on durability.  All cards are equally easy to use so here also, nothing can be said about this particular product. As regards last point of storage capacity, when I am buying 64 GB card, it will give me 64 GB storage space so what is so special about it?Anyway, this card is fast enough for my highest quality full HD video being streamed from my video camera or even from DSLR.

  Both the 64GB memory card and adapter are in good condition. At Rs 699 got a substantial discount the MRP being Rs 1899. Recorded 4K UHD videos on my Asus Zenfone Max Pro M1. Could play it back without any lag. Copied to my old Windows 7 Lenovo Z580 laptop using the adapter in the microSD card slot. Could save the 4K file easily on the laptop. Tried the memory card + adapter in my DSLR Canon 1300 D. Saves pics fast and easy. Don't know whether it could record 4K UHD videos in the card as my DSLR does'nt have that high resolution. But the mobile does. 4KUHS 1 requires 4.2 gb for a 01 hr video and 4K UHD requires around 32 GB for the same duration. The microSD card has been manufactured in the Phillipines and has a 10 yr warranty. But the adapter is of Chinese make and has a warranty of only 01 yr. Edges of the microSD card are white. So its definitely an original Samsung one. It could be a good back up card for even professional photographers.

  Remember that in SD Cards, there are Classes and Grades and UHS I and II and... UGH!  Gets a bit crazy. I think right now Class V90 UHS II are fastest, but really even the UHS I cards are PLENTY fast enough unless you're recording 4K video or you're always copying gigs and gigs regularly... and they're much cheaper too!So... this card was exactly as described.  Comes with bigger SD adapter so you can use in PC or phone/tablet.  Tested it using some free tools and its speed is what it should be.  Of course you don't get the actual advertised capacity in ANY storage device you buy, which is ridiculous, but that's the way it is.Had a couple SanDisk cards and one failed after almost five years (which is not too bad)... thought I'd try Samsung this time since it is so well-rated.I will update my review if things change, but so far I'm happy with this card... have pounded it hard over the past couple days and it's doing great!  Doesn't get hot either.I think you will not be disappointed.  Thanks, and please click \"Helpful\" below...

  Product = Seems Original, made in Philippines with white edges.Memory= Reflects arround 63+ GB in storage in settings of phone, but arround 58 GB if checked through other means like in storage setting of Chrome. Not checked on PC.Write Speed= Speed fluctuates from 10 MB/s to 60 MB/s, (on average 30 to 40+ MB/s) from phone's internal storage to the card, though it depends on the file system, but it was really very fast. One can easily transfer very huge files in seconds.Packaging = Packaging was decent enough from the seller and as usual from the manufacturer.Card Adapter= Made in China, haven't used it yet.My verdict= Perfectly good and one must go for it.

  I purchased the best card available then, manufactured by a company like SAMSUNG. It just stopped working suddenly. The funniest part is, you can see the content on a laptop, but can't write, delete or even format (tried DOS formatting also). When inserted in the phone, it's not detected. Tried inserting in several phones, so no issue with the phone. Incidentally, the phone is also a high-end Samsung. Really frustrated with the quality. Samsung, please improve the quality of your products.

  I have both SanDisk ultra and Samsung evo plus purchased on same date . Both in 32 gb variant . Speed test shows 70 Mbps read for Samsung and 56 Mbps for SanDisk ultra and 25 Mbps write for Samsung vs 14 Mbps write for SanDisk .Test done in single mobile device.  Both cards out of the box and nothing stored.  I was a SanDisk fan earlier.  But this changed my mind . Samsung is still leader in memory chip  manufacturing.. be it SSD  RAM  etc.

  Like the fact that had no problems with the card,just popped it into my phone and it was good to go. Available storage about 63GB. Seems to be original Samsung, card made in Philippines,adapter made in China. It's a relatively new card manufactured in May '19.Smooth HD and 4K UHD video shooting with no stutter or lag. Slow motion vids also work fine. Haven't transferred any files so can't comment but rated read 100 Mb/s and 60 Mb/s write speed should be fast enough for most.Got this after my old Samsung Evo plus 32 GB filled up and expecting this to last for years also. Durable card as it is water/magnet/x-ray proof and can withstand very low or high temperatures. Comes with 10yr warranty and you can trust Samsung,leading manufacturer of storage devices. Though the mrp was 1899/-, got a deal at 700. Definitely good value. No wonder this card comes up top in most reviews.Only wish packaging was improved as it arrived in only a thin plastic cover, but no complaints as product is working fine.<U+0001F603>

  I originally wished to buy a 512GB Micro SD for my Tab but the price is too high right now so instead choose the 256GB card as I already have an identical card installed in my phone with 2yrs with no issues. As expected it is good and installed well.It gives available space as 238GB out of 256GB. If you want to buy a Micro SD card for your mobile device or Camera then this is the most reliable n fastest card out there right now.

Further, now since October 2019 card is showing \"corrupted\" status after 73GB data. Data again shows when I unmount and mount card. But again shows Corrupted next day.Very disappointed by SAMSUNG for this.Therefore I changed rating to 2 star only.

  i never trusted samsung products for storage (since once my hard drive died in just 1 1/2 years). i thought it might have changed now. evo series looked premium & the price was also a little premium as compared to other ones so i thought to give it a try....but sadly after 2 years of use it died. my stopped detecting it suddenly....i tried hooking it up on my pc but that didn't worked either. i did every thing i could to revive it but all in vain. i didnt used the card that much. only some apps were installed in it. no songs, videos or photos.... but still it died...

  Beats me how some people come to review products and claim that 32gb sdcard had only 29 gb space. how 64gb pen drive has 57 gb space. If you dont have technical knowledge, do your research and find out. Dont bring your ignorance to undermine good products because your brain is tiny. Every storage device has less capacity than advertised. This is because every storage device has to store some other identifying information which defines its own identity and the identity of its contents. It keeps some space reserved for specific reasons. Even your phone storage and laptop HDD storage works similarly. Open your selfie phone when you pout on it and check its storage, then downvote it on commerce websites because you have an ignorant arrogant tiny brain.As far as this product is concerned, its value for money and works great. I did not check read write speeds because I am not crazy or paranoid and these products are not supposed to have lightening speeds. Recommended.

  I really liked this stuff pretty much.  I have been facing  lot of lagging issues with my gadget; however,  after using this massive sd card the problem  has been sorted out. I could store all all my photos  and videos  to this store.  Recently,  i have moved  a bulk of pics and videos to sd card. As a result,  my phone works smoothly. Predominantly i like this stylish  card due to its class,  grade and high speed processing. Thanks to the technology  and samsung. I can give 5/5 because  its worthy  to every penny and long lasting.

Samsung warranty is 10 year but on card cover backside it shows 1yr physical warranty I am confused on this.6. Using it now so as of now no problem faced.7.

  Whatever written about reading and writing speed, is absolutely correct. Very much satisfied with this product, if the writing speed could b above 20mbps , then it would b nice. Anyway, this product manages to meet my satisfaction. But cant tell when this product gets corrupted., because most f the samsung cards gets corrupted without any reason, not quickly though. But it will, someday may b after a year or some months.

  A very good product was Samsung. When my previous card (also Samsung) stopped working, I ordered a 32 GB card to replace my 16 GB card. The card was super easy to install and works great! It was almost the same rate as rivals but was delivered within a day; so I opted for it as even a day with SD card in phone is difficult. I move all movies, videos and apps on the card to keep internal memory free. With so much free space, I have to think about what to install next?

  It's a class 10 u3 card which means it's for perfect. Speed is incredible. I'm using it in my Nintendo switch and I've got expected performance.Samsung memory cards are more durable than others so unless you are extremely harsh, these cards can take mild punishment like moisture and dirt (not too much but still more than cheap Chinese products).If you have to buy a new memory card, do not buy anything below 64 gb. I initially bought a 32gb card but quickly changed my mind.

  Got what I paid for. Samsung is a brand you can trust with memory, be it SSDs or memory cards.Using this card in my mobile, which formatted the card to be used as internal storage.So I am using this to mostly store apps.Read & Write speeds are best in class, and its a reliable memory card.fully satisfied.If you are confused between Sandisk Ultra vs Samsung,go with Samsung for the following reasons -1. This card came out later, which means it an updated model as compared to Sandisk ultra.2. Samsung is U3 Speed class which is faster than Sandisk's U1. (Don't confuse with UHS - 1 )3. Samsung 64 GB is 750Rs, Sandisk 64 Gb is 800Rs4. Sandisk Ultra card was released more than 10 years ago so it is optimized for Class 10 , where as Samsung EVO is UHS - 1, which is a more updated standard.5. Talking about A1 Speed certification, which is basically mobile Application write and read performance based on Random reads and write speeds, Even though Samsung lacks this and Sandisk ultra has an A1 certification, Check the Random read and write speed benchmarks done using the below links, Samsung speeds are beating the competition by miles.Benchmarks -samsung-evo-plus-microsd-review at hothardware dot comwiki/benchmarks/microsd-cards at pidramble dot comVerify your own Samsung SD card as genuine using Samsung's official software -just google Samsung sd card checker

  I dont know why they fool the customers using a fake item. I am a web developer at Samsung R&D and I know how the original item looks like. Our team makes them. The one that I received was not even a memory card. It was a toy. A 128gb sticker was stuck over the 64gb label. I inserted the toy and it didn't even recognize it since it is not genuine. Don't fall for it. I you want to buy the original one go for samsung website or an official store.

  Pros1. Nice finish2. Good build quality3. Storage capacity as promised4. Instant detection by mobile.5. Fast read write speed6. Samsung quality promise7. 5 years/ life time warranty8. Comes with adapter. Thumbs up for that.Cons1. I am yet to find one.Verdict:There are other brands also offering same capacity at lower price. I recommend it if you find special prices during offer period. But it's a very good product. Can be bought without any doubt.

  You should prefer buying 64 GB upwards rather than 32, because the 32 GB one gets used up pretty easily. For people you store less of data in their device I would suggest 32 GB but even if you buy a 64 its totally worth it, a little bit more space on your device won't hurt you. Now a days every devices support min. 128 GB on external storage so buying a 64 GB wont cause any compatible issues but if you need to verify it I'll suggest you google your device external storage capacity. No offence but I'll choose Samsung over Sandisk because all those Sandisk cards I bought earlier had gone corrupted usually on a usage of between 1 - 2 years, so i would suggest you buying Samsung memory cards.

  Fake 128GB micro SD card is sold by Appario Retail Private Ltd. In Amazon.in look at the Picture review its totally Fake by looking at the memory card we can totally differentiate between original and duplicate especially the Golden strip behind the memory card is painted with golden colour which is fake and there is no Manufacturing details behind the memory card which is written in all the memory card and the company name samsung is also totally painted fake.

  The product said this unit is manufactured in Phillipines and was imported to India and had a barcode number \"8806088670676\" but however this was a sticker and when I peeled it off then it was actually a Chinese counterfeit product with the barcode number \"8806088676388\". I feel this is misleading information and fraud activity. I do not recommend this seller as he is fooling amazon as well as buyers like us.

  The funniest thing is that,in the settings-Storage option, it shows the available capacity to use out of 64gb is 62gb.But when we connect the memory card into pc via usb or card reader we can see that only 58gb is available to use.Onemore thing everyone should know that you can't copy above 4gb files by using any file manager available now a days.But you can done it through via pc.Quality of the product is cheap i don't know how long it lasts.

  This is Grade 3 Class 10 memory. It was expected to be faster than Grade 1 memory card but is not even matching the speed of it. It is considerably slow and a waste of money to purchase.I have seen many of positive reviews for it, that's why I bought. May be there is some error in my memory card. But my 32GB Grade 1 memory card is working very fast against this. So, it is not worth.

  It is the best memory card and the top speed is 100 MB seconds, but I confirm because there is a 128 GB card in less than 9.9 GB, and a 256 GB card easily under 18 GB, but it is very useful, four times I BoughtThanks for giving 2 time 128 gb 2 time 256 gb.This is the tracked real fastest and high speed micro SDFast and secure delivery service and good return policy

  We received a defective sd card initially. It was very frustrating as we couldn't read it on the phone storage. we had to try it out if it worked in other phones, but it didn't. (We did not expect this for a Samsung Product.)We then initiated a replacement, which was sent to us in just two days (which was appreciated). The second sd card was fine. Amazon service was prompt.

  Everything is ok.but after introduction to my Samsung Galaxy C9Pro. It shows 1.38/119 gb. It means it has got only 119 gb storage capacity and 1.38 gb is already been used for software. So the total capacity is 117.62gb .The Amazon delivery agent delivered the item to somebody without informing me. I got the item only after 6days. Its very bad.

  Purchased 64Gb card for a smartphone that came with 16Gb of internal memory. The card comes with class 10 rating which definitely makes your files transfer fast.I have used the same card in a SLR and a DSLR and the card did not slow down the performance of my camera. So you can definitely purchase for your use.

  I received it intact and properly packed in a bubble wrap which was put in a plastic amazon pouch. The card was as expected and I have already started using it. It works as it is supposed to.Recently, I had to backup all the data from it to my laptop, and I noticed the speed to be around 40 to 70 Mpbs not 90 or hundred. However, this may be dependent on many other aspects like the storage where you are transferring it, your laptop's response and also the tiny and big files that are being transferred. The data size was around 16 gb which had many folders and many small and large files.The write speed I don't remember properly buy it was also around 40 to 50 Mbps.

  Purchased twice. Speed is good.Can't choose between majors like Smsung, sandsk, lxar, kingstn on bases of speed. However I have bad experience of sandsk about durability. Not one but twice. That's why Samsung reccomended. One star less due to value for money. Adapter should be optional and 100 RS. less

  I am writing this review with a very delightful mood. I just wanna say do not think about any other card. *SAMSUNG* was and will be the best in class for storage before sandisk and Kingston. I will say that if you buy 128gb just buy this. Class 10 grade 3 ufs-I. The speed I'm getting is around 60mbps average. You can see xender transfer rates. Though xender can only send upto 15mbps. Host device is Asus zenfone max pro m2 with samsung 32gb class 10 grade 1. And my device is poco f1. And the 4k is outstanding now. Believe me... No lags nothing. Just killer.

  Okk...so I am writing this review after two and half months of usage. This might be one of the best SD Card bought as I have terrible experience with some of the cheap products of same valueThe best part of this SD card was that it copied 27GB of data (one single movie) with high speed of 64mbps avg. How is it different....other sd card doesn't copy a single file of more than 4.49GB.Also copying speed has remain constant even after two and half months of usage.My advice.....go for it without second thought.

  The storage is 29.83GB total. I know the rest is used for system files etc but it's 32GB it should be atleast 30.5GB. Odk.Also, the reading and writing speed mentioned are wrong. It's actually very less that that. It's okay, yes but not what mentioned. Never got up to the mentioned reading or writing speed.Overall I guess it's alright for the price. The free adapter with it is amazing and very helpful if you own a camera or laptop or anything that uses that type of SD card.

  Been using this card for 3 months. So far no problem. Getting speed in between 30 to 40 Mb/s on a mid range processor.Appario Retails Prvt Lmt is the best seller in Amazon. When purchasing something like memory cards it's so easy to be cheated with a counterfeit product since these kind of cheap chinese made memory cards are in abundance in the market. Only way to make sure you get a genuine product that too, recently made and imported product is to buy that product from Appario Retail Pvt Lmt from Amazon.I got this card for 674 bucks. 699 as an offer and further 25 amazon cash back for QR code payment through Amazon Pay for a CoD purchase.

  By far one of the best memory cards I have purchased. A great investment. You get 119GB of usable space. It's reliable and I haven't lost data stored on this at all. I was using the Sandisk 64GB Extreme Pro class 10 A card in my GoPro hero 7 black earlier and there were numerous times where the data stored was simply lost or the file would be corrupted. That's when I bought the Samsung card and it's been a beauty to have.

In spite of paying 799 RS I am getting apxx 6 GB less which is not acceptable.

I purchased it at comfortable price at Rs.1319 and that was a great deal to me.It has available storage of 119GB out of 128GB.

If u r using it for phone and camera only than format it into FAT(32) but if u r using it for moving big data files such as disc images or big movies copying from PC than use it in NTFS because u can't copy a big data in FAT but in NTFS file system.

  Samsung will never fail to impress their customers. Its perfect memory card for everyday use and some heavy task like storage for games. Although rated speed is 100 MBPS, it provides 20-30 MBPS Read speed and 10-15 MBPS write speed. Thats not much impressive.There's only one cons to this card that initialization/ detection is quite slow. I can't actually blame the technology though because error checking on a 64 gb storage will obviously be complex and time consuming.Overall, great shopping experience with amazon and Samsung.

  \"Tharaamana porul\"Unlike other brands Samsung offers exact storage as they advertised 64 gb cards have storage of 64 gb as in binary unit not as in SI unit .Very much satisfied with the shippment and delivery , as usual they are prompt.Definitely a kanna mooditu vaangalam product.And to top I got 20% cashback during prime day sale that's sugar on top. Got the product for 560<U+20B9> literally a perfect loot.

  The quality is poor as compared to my old 32 gb memory card as there are too much lagging in read and write. Phone always stop working while operating as writing or reading through memory card. I really dislike and not suggest for buying this product to anyone.

  So far so good. Comes with 63.99 GB of free space. I have used Samsung storage before and they tend to last. So expecting good things. The chip is fast and hadn't had any hiccups so far. Good deal!I am using it as storage extention for my phone.

  Available memory displayed on my Samsung J6+ is 59.79GB.. it's ok as the card takes some system memory.. Read and write speed is also as mentioned my the manufacturer.. Overall  a good product and anyone going for 64GB memory card should certainly consider this one first, real value for money. No problem in installation and card detection.Though it's my first day of usage will update after using it for say couple of months and more.

  Received 2 days back on prompt delivery. Usage & storage seems to be good. Durability will know after using for few months or years. price was reasonable due to Republic day offer sales. Amazon doing good /systematic online service. Amazon Customer care agents are very helpful. I recommend to buy this memory card. Running well in samsung A5 2016 series. Speed is excellent. 32gb or 64gb are the best to buy depending upon storage we may require. Lots of storage avlb in 64gb for songs pics etc..one time investment. Any issue amazon supports well.

  Any Samsung product especially in the SDXC memory card segment is top notch. This 128 GB SDXC memory card is not an exception. Works like a gem in my RN5P. However this product like almost all others have a dynamic pricing strategy. I bought this for 3299/- in June. However during the Amazon Prime Sale from 16th July onwards, it dropped to 2799/-. Again at the time of writing this review it is 2999/-. Inspite of the fluctuations in price, this SDXC memory card is a great addition especially for those who take lots of pictures and videos.

The only issue is that I could not register it for warranty on Samsung website. When I tried to register a message appeared that serial number does not exist/match with their records.

  After 4 Months use, I will not recommend Samsung EVO Plus Grade 3 Class 10 128GB MicroSDXC Memory Card with SD Adapter (MB-MC128GA/IN). This memory card is not perform as per specified and responsible for slowing down my phone. Each time when I restart my phone it takes almost 5-7 min to fully read card ( at present I stored only 40GB of data out of 128 GB on max). Apps stored in card are also behave unexpected and phone performance is down to hell. Thanks Amazon for providing such a bad product to your customers.

It provides a class 10 / V3 memory card... Just unbelievable. Don't think twice <U+0001F44D> just go for it <U+0001F44C><U+0001F44C>

  Great product!!! And quick delivery. Out of 128 GB, ultimately I got 119 GB which is obvious. 9 GB is needed for its own setup. Everyone should understand this. Without knowing many people blame the product. And after inserting the memory card, it shows \"Blank card\" and after that one format is needed to erase and freshly start the card. This is a systematic procedure. Everyone should know these things also before blaming. Before doing these formalities don't blame. Thank you Amazon!

  For better performance always use external memory cards with higher speed. this has a transfer speed of 100Mbps. greater the speed more will be the speed pf transfer of files as well as the performance of the equipment.i personally prefer samsung for micro SD cards especially samsung eve plus.Value for money product with high durability.

Within two year the SD Card stopped working and showing disk is write protected message.The SD Card was in only one device (Android Mobile) and started problem.Tried all the resolution steps available online but nothing worked.I tried Samsung customer care and there is no direct support for memory cards... But they are cheating by saying 10 years warranty support.

  A fairly good buy for <U+20B9>699. Packaging included a SD adapter along with the MicroSD card.Speeds during read were as high as 85MBps which is good for the price. Write speeds were sustained at around 19MBps during large file transfers.The card does suffer speed drops to speeds as low as 1MBps during multiple small file transfers which is understandable. Overall, given the price point, it's a good card for multimedia usage.

  Three star just because I used this Card with Redmi 4A and after two months it is not read by device. Though it is usable with card reader but leave me disappointed somewhere. Don't understand the exact reason why it stopped work with phone. Otherwise good to have it.

  I bought this as a present for somrone on 6th Feb. I now am told by them that the product was installed on Samsung note 8 and it never worked. I today checked it on a computer and the card is not getting sensed. Seems it was corrupted from day one. It is supposed to carry a warranty for 10 years. Please help me on this

  Although the capacity of the micro sd is rated at 64 GB, it can take in only 59.5 GB. Where are the remaining 4.5 GB gone. The system files do not necessarily occupy more than 500 Mbs. Otherwise the Sd card is good, fast and in good shape.

  Quite impressive, Samsung is one of the best in memory department and R & D of course. Overall experience is good, what I wasn't expecting is almost more than 5 times the transfer rate of standard class 10 card with grade 1, this is 3 more power to you.

  , it's average product not good or excellent. It's not high speed (it's mentioned but not true) it's just increses storage. If you're looking for a quality product (I mean for a quality video and pictures and others speed related) definitely it's not for you. If you want normal + speed and only big storage then go for it's

  First of all don't believe those comments who told or showed low write speed, they used 2.0 card reader to check the speed but they don't know the maximum speed of USB 2.0 is less than 30 Mbps.The card is very good, the read speed is lower than advertised but what we mainly need is write speed which is much higher.My my opinion its a great sd card for DSLRs or Action Cameras.

  Never ever buy Samsung memory card. If there is a problem in your memory card, then Samsung says that you will have to go to Lucknow or Ghaziabad by taking a bill of paper. Only then will your memory card be replaced. So that I suggest to all of you buy SanDisk memory instead of Samsung. Sanddisk provide us to best replacement services.

  Yesterday I received this SD-Card and it's working fine and nice I tend to avoid SD-Card from Samsung cause they sometimes conflict with some electric devices and aren't very compatible with but if you're using just for expanding storage of your mobile then it's fine go ahead and order it and you'll be satisfied.

  A standard micro sd card which does pretty much what it says, provide 128GB of storage. It is compatible with mobile phones and also camcorders (I use it with a GoPro Hero 7). Also, it comes with an attachment which can be used to plug it with a PC using a USB and transfer data.

  Best memory card in the price to be used as internal storage configuration of android 6 marshmallow. Good speed, ease to install and comes with an adapter to be used in other electronics.Warning if you use the card as internal memory for Android marshmallow then kindly update your card data to data storage site or any  other device as you have to format it when using it in other device. Not a problem with this card is common to all cards as it's marshmallow's problem

  This memory card outperform any memory card in this price segment. Super fast read/write speed. It comes with SD adapter, so instead of spending extra amount for SD for your DSLR cameras, you can buy this and use it with the adapter. You will get the same speed and result. SD card with the same read/write speed cost around 50% or 100% more than the microSD.

  It is a high speed 85 MHz micro sd card . The quality of Samsung products is of course undisputable. In this case I got the best price as well as a quality product.

  Positive-1- Feels Durable.2- Good quality plastic used in making the memory card.3- Memory card adapter is also provided.4- Decent Read & Write speed considering the price and type of card you are paying for.Negative-1- The memory card adapter feels like made with low quality plastic.2- Samsung is famous for making Micro SD card and portable Hard drives which are usually made in Philippines, but this one is (Made in China).Suggestion-1- If you have a tight budget then go for it and if budget is not the main concern then go for (Pro version).

  I tested the speed on my i5, 8GB ram laptop, and found the read and write speeds to be: 29MB/s & 26MB/s (Megabytes) resp. with the samsung sd adapter, which is still a good speed!

  Almost everything is good about this SD card., but Im little concern about why the storage capacity has only 29.8 GB out of 32 GB. It should be at least 30 Plus. Anyway Im happy with it.
