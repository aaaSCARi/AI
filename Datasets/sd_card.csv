4,"  Simply mind blowing product .. flawlessly recording of 4k recording.The write speed of the card is good. If u want to check ur card speed simply buy USB 3 card reader and put ur memory card in it then plug it to usb 3 port of ur laptop or computer what u have. I got write speed of 75 mb/sec and read speed to 90 mb/sec.There is lots of fake card available in online..if u want to purchase card simply ask the seller about it from where is it made from like made in China,Japan, Europe,korea, Philippines or Vietnam.Don't buy made in china very poor quality .Made in Vietnam is super quality but not available in India.Made in Philippines , Japan or Korea is best I have tested and I got good respond on it.",5.0 out of 5 stars
5,"  This is unbelievable, got malfunctioned in 2 weeks to my surprise. Inserted in mobile later and can't read. Took to replace, the guy checked.

6,"  Not as expected!! Speed is very slow in USB 2 port of the computer.  it's just 10 MBPS write speed.  Took more than 12 mins to copy 3 GB file. My other brand memory card took only 7 mins to copy the same files.Need to check in USB 3 port.In mobile phone it's normal like other memory cards,Max Write speed is 35 MBPS.Max Read speed is 80 MBPS.No Speed performance observed.Just normal memory card like other brands. 1700 Rs is high for this card.Other brands available for less than 1400.",3.0 out of 5 stars
7,  I was having a terrible time with my class4 transcend card so New memory card purchase was inevitable ! As i have more trust - i went for samsung.Got this one for 650rs.

9,  Original samsung product with samsung logo and what a speed of both read and write speed:Read - 100mbps/sWrite - 60mbps and sometimes more than 60mbps/sIt is also supported well under drone and action cameras like go pro and can capture burst shoot photos very fast without any frame skipping.The transfer rate is also good when you install any apps or games in the SD card. The application performance works well without any slowness or lagging.Just go for it!! You will not be regret afterwards,5.0 out of 5 stars
10,"  First of all thank Amazon for wonderful fast delivery before time.  The product is good  I am already using samsung 4 memory cards of 16GB, 32GB,  64 GB and this new one 64GB .  Samsung is a good brand like sandisk is also a good one but it charge prices more than other brands that is too bad,  not fair enough.  Coming to durability I'm using others from past 5 yrs no issues till now,  next one about its quality very good,  now. If I talk about  about  it's storage capacity it disappoints me little bit as it actually offers 59GB(approx)  out 64GB ,I don't know what the hell is remaining 5Gb,  they are doing means it contains application or system apps.  But still 5GB is a very big storage which is proving to be unuseful.  Otherwise overall good.",4.0 out of 5 stars
11,"  Delivered on second day.. useable memory is 28GB ... bought it for 619... mrp is 1,100.. highly recommended at this price..and most important the pqckaging says manufactured in september 2017 so complete 10 yrs warranty",5.0 out of 5 stars

13,  Product shipment fast. Most Samsung card in local store are duplicates. This one from Appario found original. Made in Philippines. Card i got from Malaysia last year made in Malaysia from Samsung had 95 and 83mbps. Indian version seem little slow . I found read speed surprisingly low than san disk. But SanDisk write speed is 35mbps in india for same price. Sandisk A1 card. So I'm okey with overall. SanDisk read is always above 70mbps in A1 card above 64gb. 32 gb cards of both brands have less speed. I don't know y. Speed is depend on size of card,4.0 out of 5 stars
14,  I kept it and did not checked.  When put in phone it is full with virus.  I cannot erase anything in it. Nor it is formatting.Worst. I can't send it back as i have overdue replacement days.  But plz do not buy.,1.0 out of 5 stars
15,"  i have purchased it , and after 2 years of use it stop working then i contacted samsung service center,but they just checked and said their is scratch on memory card so I can not claim warranty, they will check the scratches under the microscope so if once you purchased it then forgot about the warranty. very bad experience, even sandisk memory card is way more better and cheaper using since more then 6 years.",1.0 out of 5 stars
16,"  Samsung Evo Plus Class 10 is the best and top-of-the-line micro SD card you can buy. Better performance (read/write speeds) than SanDisk class 10. I purchased it at Rs. 614/- Look out for offers during festivals and season sales, the price fluctuates between Rs. 600-1000.",5.0 out of 5 stars
17,  This is what was shipped to me.Looks like a fake to me. A sticker of 128gb on top of a 64gb package. Even through the packing.. one can make out that the micro sd card itself is a fake with a saumsung sticker (bad imitation).The SD card adaptor is also missing.Please do NOT order this item.,1.0 out of 5 stars
18,  Nice and fast memory card. i have had issues with other memory cards which auto unmount and mount due to data read failures. there is no such error with this one. It has been quite stable and lets me store lots of data and the read speeds are almost as if i am moving data in the internal memory.no dislikes as of now.,5.0 out of 5 stars
19,"  When you are using your phone extensively for media consumption, photography and entertainment, increasing storage of your device becomes very important. While doing this you don't want to  slow down your device. What I love about this card is:-------------------------------------------------Initial impressions:‚úìThis is by far the best micro sd card I have owned. I have used cheap cards in the past and at some point they will give up and you will loose your data.‚úì Tip: Using Samsung micro SD card will not slow down your device due to the latest technology used.-------------------------------------------------Whats in the box:‚úì 1 x Samsung microSD card.-------------------------------------------------Pros:‚úì Reliable and you will not loose data after prolonged useÔºåunlike the other cheap cards!!‚úì  Great speeds to retrieve data from the card, it will not slow down your device.‚úì Easy to install.‚úì Water resistant technology.‚úì Dust proof.‚úì Samsung's reliability.‚úì 1 year warranty.-------------------------------------------------Cons:‚úì Could be priced better.-------------------------------------------------Verdict:‚úìThough the price is slightly high the Pros out weigh the cons and the card passes with flying colours. I will recommend it!",5.0 out of 5 stars
20,"  Go through my review once before buying this memory card.Using this memory card since a month now. Packaging has hologram so I'm relieved about genuineness. This card was my first choice as it supports 4K recording so I'm using it in both action camera and mobile.Performance : 95%Quality : 95%Features : 90%Value for money : 95%Overall Rating: 94%PERFORMANCE :I did benchmark tests & performance was considerable. Read & write speeds are not what Samsung advertised but it's acceptable as performance varies with many factors.BENCHMARK RESULT :Read : 84 MB/sWrite : 42 MB/s[ Check screenshots added with review ]HARDWARE :This memory card is Class 10 UHS - I U3 certified. It's water-proof, temperature proof, magnet proof and X-Ray proof as well so I'm not worried about any loss of data under such conditions.FINAL VERDICT :Samsung Evo Plus is an easy buy because it's fast enough for a smartphone or tablet and action camera as well. It comes with a full-size SD adapter, so don't worry about buying one separately and also it comes with 10 year warranty for peace of mind.I hope this helped you.",5.0 out of 5 stars
21,"  Samsung Note 8 can't read/detect this card. Plus tried on another phone as well. Couldn't read on that also. Sending it back. So replacing it with a similar unusable card won't help. Couldn't find a money back option, only replacement. Can seller please contact me?",1.0 out of 5 stars
22,"  I got the 64 gigs version of this microSD card for my Poco F1 at 1000 bucks. Had an old 32 gigs card before, where I had all my media library. I backed it up to my laptop, then transferred it to this new card. Got a steady 20 MB/s speed for moving around 20 gigs of data. But when transferring media from my phone to this card, it maintained a speed of around 80 MB/s. Overall, I'm happy with this purchase.",4.0 out of 5 stars
23,  Read and write speed is really good. It is been more than a month and working great. Highly recommend this product to all. Look for lighting deal for best price to buy.,5.0 out of 5 stars
24,"  Beast of a deal! Functionally no issues. Works like a charm. Gives very good read/write speeds in my Redmi Note 4.Though it appears to be of the standard microSD card dimensions, it was not a perfect fit in the Redmi Note 4 tray. I was not able to slot it perfectly onto the tray. However, the tray can be closed despite the ill-fitting card, so am able to use it.Would have given full 5 stars if not for the tolerance issue with slotting-in onto the card tray.",4.0 out of 5 stars
25,  I‚Äôm using this SD Cards form Past 2 Years.I have 4 Sd cards of 64 GB capacity each card provide around 56GB usable space.Read write speed of Samsung SD Card is Quite good and I bought it for 699‚Çπ on Amazon Prime day sale. And it‚Äôs comes with 10 Year Warranty,5.0 out of 5 stars
26,"  I was earlier sent a fake card which I identified in 1 second.Then I ordered a replacement online through Amazon and now I finally got an ORIGINAL Samsung card.I've attached photos the real card's packaging, so you may decide wisely what card you're getting... If you feel something is wrong (detail not matching order, wrong fonts, bad quality print, etc.) return it by going to ""My order"" on Amazon and ask for original one immediately....The write speed, as guaranteed by U3 marking should be above 30MB/ second as per Memory card association.In my card it was claimed to be 90MB/ second on package, and 100MB/ second read speed.Of course, on an older system with no so accurate readers, you get around 20 MB/ second maximum. But on newer mobiles phones, you do get upto 60-90 MB/second or so.This card is good for phones supporting SDXC, and remember, it may also be supported on phones which claim to support much less.Example, My Redmi 2 Prime claimed to support only 32GB, and guess what, 64 and even 128 GB cards from both Samsung and Sandisk were supported and ran awesome!! Please remember SDXC standard supports very high capacities, maybe upto 512 GB. SDHC, an older standard supports only upto 32GB.Card was made in Phillipines. A useful SD adaptor (with a writing-lock switch) was supplied which was made in China.Capacity that came was 119GB, which is slightly more than 128,000,000,000 bytes.(The difference in capacity is due to 1024 bytes=1KB and 1024KB= 1MB and 1024 MB = 1GB).",4.0 out of 5 stars

28,"  The product from samsung is very good .It gives you good read and write speed . In my test it gave me around 30mb write speed. I have booked this product one from amazon and one from flipkart at the rate of Rs. 500/= on offer period.Both the product are original and good read and write speed.I am happy with my purchase and ordered one more from flipkart because the courier service of flipkart is better than amazon. They always deliver the product at home . But amazon courier boy always left the product here and there and they dont mind to inform us where they left our product and later  We have to search for it asking everyone. Especially this things happen when we order on prepaid. So, I prefer cash on delivery than prepaid. That is the only minus point, otherwise every thing is fine.",4.0 out of 5 stars
29,"  When buying storage solution better buy it from renounce brands, samsung might good for Mobile ,but with storage solution they r worst. Not even last 6 month.

Which I received .. and from the pictures posted here .. the packaging also is so bad .There is video on YouTube which I seen aftr I ordered the earlier card.

34,"  This is a proper storage card, with no issues in data transfer and storage. Rate of data transmission is good, can be used as phones default storage with no loss in speed/efficiency.Durability is great, won't break on falling or under a bit pressure, water proof - just dry it out first before using. I bought the 64 gb variant at offer price, one gets about 61gb depending on the phone with which you are using. On offer price of Rs 949 should buy it.",5.0 out of 5 stars

36,"  It has only been a couple of months when I bought this card so can‚Äôt comment on durability.  All cards are equally easy to use so here also, nothing can be said about this particular product. As regards last point of storage capacity, when I am buying 64 GB card, it will give me 64 GB storage space so what is so special about it?Anyway, this card is fast enough for my highest quality full HD video being streamed from my video camera or even from DSLR.",5.0 out of 5 stars

39,"  Product = Seems Original, made in Philippines with white edges.Memory= Reflects arround 63+ GB in storage in settings of phone, but arround 58 GB if checked through other means like in storage setting of Chrome. Not checked on PC.Write Speed= Speed fluctuates from 10 MB/s to 60 MB/s, (on average 30 to 40+ MB/s) from phone's internal storage to the card, though it depends on the file system, but it was really very fast. One can easily transfer very huge files in seconds.Packaging = Packaging was decent enough from the seller and as usual from the manufacturer.Card Adapter= Made in China, haven't used it yet.My verdict= Perfectly good and one must go for it.",5.0 out of 5 stars
40,"  Needed an SD card for work and travwmlkmg purposes and heard great things about Samsung's Evo series.Unfortunately I got a fake one, the SD card was orange in colour (as opposed to red) and didn't fit properly. It even had paint peeling off the SD card. Be very careful. Had ordered for a replacement.",1.0 out of 5 stars
41,"  Remember that in SD Cards, there are Classes and Grades and UHS I and II and... UGH!  Gets a bit crazy. I think right now Class V90 UHS II are fastest, but really even the UHS I cards are PLENTY fast enough unless you're recording 4K video or you're always copying gigs and gigs regularly... and they're much cheaper too!So... this card was exactly as described.  Comes with bigger SD adapter so you can use in PC or phone/tablet.  Tested it using some free tools and its speed is what it should be.  Of course you don't get the actual advertised capacity in ANY storage device you buy, which is ridiculous, but that's the way it is.Had a couple SanDisk cards and one failed after almost five years (which is not too bad)... thought I'd try Samsung this time since it is so well-rated.I will update my review if things change, but so far I'm happy with this card... have pounded it hard over the past couple days and it's doing great!  Doesn't get hot either.I think you will not be disappointed.  Thanks, and please click ""Helpful"" below...",5.0 out of 5 stars

43,"  I purchased the best card available then, manufactured by a company like SAMSUNG. It just stopped working suddenly. The funniest part is, you can see the content on a laptop, but can't write, delete or even format (tried DOS formatting also). When inserted in the phone, it's not detected. Tried inserting in several phones, so no issue with the phone. Incidentally, the phone is also a high-end Samsung. Really frustrated with the quality. Samsung, please improve the quality of your products.",1.0 out of 5 stars

Speed test shows 70 Mbps read for Samsung and 56 Mbps for SanDisk ultra and 25 Mbps write for Samsung vs 14 Mbps write for SanDisk .Test done in single mobile device.  Both cards out of the box and nothing stored.  I was a SanDisk fan earlier.  But this changed my mind .

48,"  Like the fact that had no problems with the card,just popped it into my phone and it was good to go. Available storage about 63GB. Seems to be original Samsung, card made in Philippines,adapter made in China. It's a relatively new card manufactured in May '19.Smooth HD and 4K UHD video shooting with no stutter or lag. Slow motion vids also work fine. Haven't transferred any files so can't comment but rated read 100 Mb/s and 60 Mb/s write speed should be fast enough for most.Got this after my old Samsung Evo plus 32 GB filled up and expecting this to last for years also. Durable card as it is water/magnet/x-ray proof and can withstand very low or high temperatures. Comes with 10yr warranty and you can trust Samsung,leading manufacturer of storage devices. Though the mrp was 1899/-, got a deal at 700. Definitely good value.

It's authentic and manufactured by Samsung India and source is Phillipines and adapter from China. It's price should be <=‚Çπ1500 then only the deal will be profitable.

56,"  Beats me how some people come to review products and claim that 32gb sdcard had only 29 gb space. how 64gb pen drive has 57 gb space. If you dont have technical knowledge, do your research and find out. Dont bring your ignorance to undermine good products because your brain is tiny. Every storage device has less capacity than advertised. This is because every storage device has to store some other identifying information which defines its own identity and the identity of its contents. It keeps some space reserved for specific reasons. Even your phone storage and laptop HDD storage works similarly. Open your selfie phone when you pout on it and check its storage, then downvote it on commerce websites because you have an ignorant arrogant tiny brain.As far as this product is concerned, its value for money and works great. I did not check read write speeds because I am not crazy or paranoid and these products are not supposed to have lightening speeds. Recommended.",5.0 out of 5 stars

65,  I purchased this 128GB samsung Sd Card and the storage capacity is only 32GB though the chip i received is a 128GB card. Big time hardware fault. I am unable to return this device since the time has lapsed now. I want amazon folks to act on this.

74,  I dont know why they fool the customers using a fake item. I am a web developer at Samsung R&D and I know how the original item looks like. Our team makes them. The one that I received was not even a memory card. It was a toy. A 128gb sticker was stuck over the 64gb label. I inserted the toy and it didn't even recognize it since it is not genuine.

77,"  It's a class 10 u3 card which means it's for perfect. Speed is incredible. I'm using it in my Nintendo switch and I've got expected performance.Samsung memory cards are more durable than others so unless you are extremely harsh, these cards can take mild punishment like moisture and dirt (not too much but still more than cheap Chinese products).If you have to buy a new memory card, do not buy anything below 64 gb. I initially bought a 32gb card but quickly changed my mind.",5.0 out of 5 stars

79,"  A very good product was Samsung. When my previous card (also Samsung) stopped working, I ordered a 32 GB card to replace my 16 GB card. The card was super easy to install and works great! It was almost the same rate as rivals but was delivered within a day; so I opted for it as even a day with SD card in phone is difficult. I move all movies, videos and apps on the card to keep internal memory free. With so much free space, I have to think about what to install next?",5.0 out of 5 stars
80,"  You should prefer buying 64 GB upwards rather than 32, because the 32 GB one gets used up pretty easily. For people you store less of data in their device I would suggest 32 GB but even if you buy a 64 its totally worth it, a little bit more space on your device won't hurt you. Now a days every devices support min. 128 GB on external storage so buying a 64 GB wont cause any compatible issues but if you need to verify it I'll suggest you google your device external storage capacity. No offence but I'll choose Samsung over Sandisk because all those Sandisk cards I bought earlier had gone corrupted usually on a usage of between 1 - 2 years, so i would suggest you buying Samsung memory cards.",3.0 out of 5 stars

83,  I am writing this review with a very delightful mood. I just wanna say do not think about any other card. *SAMSUNG* was and will be the best in class for storage before sandisk and Kingston. I will say that if you buy 128gb just buy this. Class 10 grade 3 ufs-I. The speed I'm getting is around 60mbps average. You can see xender transfer rates. Though xender can only send upto 15mbps. Host device is Asus zenfone max pro m2 with samsung 32gb class 10 grade 1. And my device is poco f1. And the 4k is outstanding now. Believe me... No lags nothing. Just killer.,5.0 out of 5 stars

86,"  I received it intact and properly packed in a bubble wrap which was put in a plastic amazon pouch. The card was as expected and I have already started using it. It works as it is supposed to.Recently, I had to backup all the data from it to my laptop, and I noticed the speed to be around 40 to 70 Mpbs not 90 or hundred. However, this may be dependent on many other aspects like the storage where you are transferring it, your laptop's response and also the tiny and big files that are being transferred. The data size was around 16 gb which had many folders and many small and large files.The write speed I don't remember properly buy it was also around 40 to 50 Mbps.",5.0 out of 5 stars

When purchasing something like memory cards it's so easy to be cheated with a counterfeit product since these kind of cheap chinese made memory cards are in abundance in the market.
